# Project Title: Automated attendance using face recognition

## Description
As we all know that most of the institutions use manual attendance marking, which is labor-intensive and also more prone to errors. The system that I intend to build solves this issue. Automated attendance using face recognition is labor free, eliminates the need for physical touchpoints and also less prone to human errors.. The `V3.ipynb` notebook contains the model training process, while `Predict.py` is used for applying the trained model to make predictions.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-repository-directory]
```

## Usage
- `V3.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook includes the steps for training the machine learning model. It covers data preparation, model building, and training processes.
- `Predict.py`: Use this script to apply the trained model for making predictions. It includes functions for image processing, boundary box drawing, and displaying predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, MTCNN, etc. 

## Data
Describe the data used in this project, including how to access and prepare it for training and prediction.
